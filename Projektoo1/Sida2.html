<h4>Healthier Brownies<br>
Easy and delicous!<br>
Prep Time: 10 minutes<br>
Servings: 12<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 cup + 2 Tbsp (110g) super fine almond flour (spoon and level to measure)<br>
1/2 cup (43g) unsweetened cocoa powder (spoon and level)<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
1/4 tsp baking powder<br>
1 cup (170g) pitted Medjool dates (about 11)<br>
1/4 cup (80g) honey<br>
1/4 cup (60g) coconut oil, melted<br>
2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
2 large eggs<br>
1/4 cup (42g) mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional)<br>
Instructions:<br>
1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8 by 8 inch baking dish with coconut oil (you can also line with parchment if you want to be able to easily lift them from pan).<br>
2.Add almond flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, dates, honey, coconut oil and vanilla to a food processor. <br>
3.Process until well blended and dates have been finely ground down, about 1 minute. <br>
4.Add in one egg and pulse about 15 times (or as needed) to blend then repeat with second eggs. Stir in chocolate chips with a rubber spatula.<br>
5.Spread mixture evenly into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until brownies are set (a toothpick will still come out with crumbs), about 20 - 25 minutes.<br>
6.Let cool about 5 minutes before cutting and serving. Once cool store in an airtight container.<br>
7.If you want the optional chocolate syrup, in a microwave safe bowl heat 1 Tbsp coconut oil and 1 Tbsp honey in microwave until coconut oil is melted. Stir in cocoa. Let cool slightly for a thicker consistency.<br></h4></div>

<h4>Donuts!<br>
Prep time:2h40min<br>
Ingredients:<br>
2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast <br>
1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) <br>
1½ cups lukewarm milk<br>
1/2 cup white sugar <br>
1 teaspoon salt <br>
2 eggs <br>
1/3 cup shortening <br>
5 cups all-purpose flour <br>
1 quart vegetable oil for frying <br>
1/3 cup butter <br>
2 cups confectioners' sugar <br>
1½ teaspoons vanilla <br>
4 tablespoons hot water or as needed<br>
Instructions:<br>
1.Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.<br>

2.In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remains.<br>

3.Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth.<br>

4.Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside.<br>

5.Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up.</h4>
